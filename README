It seems that it's issue for ver6.

when click at the middle height of div and middle position of string, the div over the toolbar.

after upgrade to ver7 in project use the command below, it has no longer toolbar problem.

```
npm install @ionic/core@7 @ionic/vue@7 @ionic/vue-router@7
``

I am sorry. As before, I only update global version with command:
```
npm install -g @ionic/cli
npm i  ### in project's folder
```
